===PROLLY SOME IMPORTANT VARIABLES===

timer_value

min_num_players?
max_num_players?

num_campers
num_werewolfs
num_introvert
num_campcounselors
num_bestfriends 

===FUNCTIONALITY===
timer countdown
customize settings (number of roles, customize timer countdown... etc etc)
way for people to join a game - react with emojis
randomize roles - balancing number of roles (ex. werewolves cannot outnumber campers)
voting system (use reacts? to count votes) - react with emojis
message individual their role - camp counsellor needs choice to see role of other player or pick 1/3 roles not taken
game logic obviously

===GAME FLOWCHART THINGY=== (how the game would usually go?)

#need to find a way to figure out how people would join a game

#maybe use arguments to enter settings like this?
!werewolfStart <timer> <num_campers> <num_werewolfs> <num_introverts> <num_campcounselors> <num_bestfriends>

> bot would start countdown 
> bot would send roles to individual players
> bot would somehow show camp counsellor ANOTHER PLAYERS ROLE or REVEAL TWO ROLES THAT ARE IN THE GAME (if applicable)
> then people playing would play n stuff

#when the bot is done the countdown, bot would send message with voting system

> bot sends message with emoji reacts that correspond to each player kind like that bot in discord we have in our server

===COMMANDS TO IMPLEMENT===
!werewolfStart
!werewolfEnd

============== simple logic (rough )================
Global [Player] array
React: appends players to array
Unreact: removes players from array
Game logic, if voted out: removes players from array

2D Array (or global game role array)
Maps player ID to role (randomized, game initial step)
Removes role from array if voted out

Check win conditions at the end of every turn
See if roles in array/map conflict (aka. werewolf with camper)


Timer logic
Allows voting array/map (2D?) to be edited if timer > 0
Array form: [[Player ID, # Votes], [Player ID2, # Votes]], etc
Sorted by # votes
At timer = 0, if array[0] > array[1], execute game logic
Else end day

Reacts change #votes in 2d array
