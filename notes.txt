===PROLLY SOME IMPORTANT VARIABLES===

timer_value

min_num_players?
max_num_players?

num_campers
num_werewolfs
num_introvert
num_campcounselors
num_bestfriends 

===FUNCTIONALITY===
timer countdown
customize settings (number of roles, customize timer countdown... etc etc)
way for people to join a game - react with emojis
randomize roles - balancing number of roles (ex. werewolves cannot outnumber campers)
voting system (use reacts? to count votes) - react with emojis
message individual their role - camp counsellor needs choice to see role of other player or pick 1/3 roles not taken
game logic obviously

===GAME FLOWCHART THINGY=== (how the game would usually go?)
1. Introduction

#need to find a way to figure out how people would join a game
Command to call the bot. (!werewolfStart)
People react to a message sent by the bot in the server.
Message includes 'React to join game!'

#maybe use arguments to enter settings like this?
!werewolfStart <timer_gameplay> <num_campers> <num_werewolfs> <num_introverts> <num_campcounselors> <num_bestfriends> <num_wannabes>

We need a way to parse arguments.
The arguments account for the total number of roles in the game (players + missing roles).
Error-catching (balancing) - at the end

===ROLES===

Werewolf - See the other werewolves.
Camper - Chills.
Best Friends (Pair) - See the other best friend.
Camp Counselor - See below.
Wannabe - Sees werewolves.
Introvert - Chills.

2. Night Time

First Use of Timer Preset (30 sec)
> bot would start countdown for night time
- DM players their roles using the embed links that Priscila sent on Discord

Camp Counselor (in their DMs)
Has a choice - React once
A. Pick a player to know their role.
B. Pick 1/3 unpicked roles to know (random).

If timer runs out, (i.e. the camp counselor did not react in time - reveal) the game ends (i.e. bot kills itself).

3. Actual Gameplay

Info - Another DM to remind you of your role and to vote!
Info - In public, voting time (dynamic).
Voting - Public for now when the timer runs out (Just react - once you have reacted you can't take it back)

4. End Game

Intervals between each reveal (3 sec)
Introvert -> Best Friends -> Wannabe -> Werewolves -> Campers

5. Kill the bot.
!werewolfEnd

> bot would send roles to individual players
> bot would somehow show camp counsellor ANOTHER PLAYERS ROLE or REVEAL TWO ROLES THAT ARE IN THE GAME (if applicable)
> then people playing would play n stuff

#when the bot is done the countdown, bot would send message with voting system

> bot sends message with emoji reacts that correspond to each player kind like that bot in discord we have in our server
:regional_indicator_a: :regional_indicator_b: :regional_indicator_c: IN DISCORD

>clean up and exit
